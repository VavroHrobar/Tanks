      <h2>Brief history</h2>
      <p>
        Germany's armored force was not especially impressive from a technical standpoint at the start of the war. As noted above,
        it was their advanced combined arms doctrine and unrivaled command-and-control capability that gave German mechanized forces their advantage on the battlefield.
        Pre-war plans called for two main tanks: the main tank was to be the Panzer III medium tank, supported by smaller numbers of the howitzer-armed Panzer IV.
        However, by the beginning of the invasion of Poland, only a few hundred of these vehicles were available.
        As a result, the invasions of Poland and France were carried out primarily with the less capable Panzer I and Panzer II light tanks (armed with machine guns and a 20 mm gun respectively),
        with some gun armed light tanks of Czechoslovak design (Panzer 35(t) and Panzer 38(t), both armed with a 37 mm gun). Even in 1941, Panzer III production amounted only to about a thousand tanks,
        forcing the Germans to use Czech tanks as substitutes for the Panzer III. As the war proceeded, production of heavier tanks increased.
       </p>
       <p>
         The Panzer III was intended to fight other tanks; in the initial design stage a 50 mm (2 inch) gun was specified. However,
         the infantry at the time were being equipped with the 37 mm (1.46 inch) PaK 36, and it was thought that in the interest of standardization the tanks should carry the same armament.
         As a compromise, the turret ring was made large enough to accommodate a 50 mm (2 inch) gun should a future upgrade be required.
         This single decision later assured the Panzer III a prolonged life in the German Army.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the Panzer IV, originally intended to be a support tank, became the de facto main medium tank re-armed with a long-barreled,
          high velocity 75 mm gun to counter the T-34; the Panzer III, with its smaller turret ring, could not mount a gun larger than 50 mm, which had become inadequate against Allied tanks.
          The Germans started to develop newer, heavier tanks. This included the Panzer V Panther, which was intended to be the new main German medium tank.
          The Panther tank was a compromise of various requirements. While sharing essentially the same engine as the Tiger I tank, it had better frontal armor,
          better gun penetration, was lighter overall and thus faster, and could handle rough terrain better than the Tigers. The trade-off was much weaker side armor;
          the Panther proved to be deadly in open country and shooting from long range, but was vulnerable in close-quarters combat or to flank shots.
          The Germans also started to develop a new series of heavy tanks. The first was the Tiger,
          which outclassed all its opponents in terms of firepower and armor when it was first put into operational use.
          The even heavier Tiger II (deemed "King Tiger" by Allied troops) supplemented the Tiger I late in the war.
          Its powerful gun and very heavy armor made it superior to nearly every Allied or Soviet tank in a one-on-one confrontation, but poor mobility, speed and reliability limited its use.
          Plans were made for a super-heavy tank, the Panzer VII Löwe,
          which was cancelled during the design stage in favor of the yet heavier Panzer VIII Maus of which only two incomplete prototype were made.
          Panzer IX and Panzer X were drawings only used for propaganda purposes.

      <h3 class="h3-right">Panzer VI Tiger heavy tank</h3>
      <img class="img-float2" src="../Pictures/Tiger.png" alt="Panzer VI Tiger" width="500" height="200">
      <p>
        When comparing the small number of Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausf.E (Sd Kfz 181) Tiger Tanks produced (only 1346),
        to the more than 120,000 T-34s and Shermans combined, one can appreciate the psychological impact of this model,
        at least from the Allied tank crew perspective. In its concept laid the very core of the German conception of a heavy tank.
        Something which targeted absolute excellence in design, combining lethality with the best possible protection, only given to elite crews,
        all this regardless of the cost. Excellent engineering and training versus numbers underlined all this philosophy and was reflected, later, in small tactical unit operations.
       </p>
       <p>
          The Tiger was a formidable machine that pushed the boundaries of armored warfare and forced the Allies to devise better tanks.
          It powerfully symbolized all the might of the Nazi war machine, as dreamed off by Hitler, and later turned through propaganda into a “Wunderwaffe” (wonder weapon) in a mostly defensive war.
          The Tiger, like all new tanks, had teething problems at first and it was never an easy tank to maintain, but it was always deadly effective (with a 10:1 up to 19:1 kill ratio),
          earning a capital of fear that was unrivaled during the war. Allied crews found themselves hopeless with their inadequate machines, having to improvise costly tactics to deal with it.
          The Tiger gave fame to a few WWII tank aces, like Michael Wittman, something rarely heard of before, since the life expectancy of a tank crew was always quite shorter than that of fighter pilots.

      <h3 class="h3-right">Panzer V Panther medium tank</h3>
      <img class="img-float2" src="../Pictures/Panther.png" alt="Panzer V Panther" width="500" height="200">
      <p>
        Military historians still debate about which was the best tank of the Second World War,
        but for all the polls and spec comparisons, the Panzer V Panther is always one of the contenders.
        Given its speed and off-road capabilities, tremendous firepower, protection, sophisticated targeting sights,
        use of equipment far ahead of its time (like infrared vision) and, last but not least, the more than 6000 machines built,
        the Panther can be compared to a main battle tank, years before the British Centurion appeared. Being one the best-balanced designs of WWII,
        it performed accordingly, with a fear capital almost rivaling that of the Tiger.
      </p>
      <p>
        In June 1941, during a seemingly unstoppable advance, the first encounters with T-34s really shook the General Staff,
        as more and more reports signaled that a Russian tank was found superior to both the upgraded Panzer III and the Panzer IV.
        After many had been captured in relatively good order, Heinz Guderian ordered a full report to be drawn by a Panzerkommision, dispatched to assess the T-34.
        It was noted that the combination of thick, well-sloped armor,
        a very effective 76.2 mm (3 in) gun and good power-to-weight ratio combined with large tracks meant that the Russian tank almost reached the “impossible triangle” that characterized
        a perfect medium tank. This was unmatched in the German arsenal, raising concerns, which in turn needed prompt reactions.
        As soon as April 1942, both Daimler Benz and MAN AG were charged to design the VK 30.02, a 30-35 ton tank incorporating all the aspects underlined by the report.

      <h3 class="h3-right">Panzer II</h3>
      <img class="img-float2" src="../Pictures/Panzer.png" alt="Panzer II" width="500" height="200">
      <p>
        Both the Panzer I and II were considered as stopgaps before the arrival of more advanced models, namely the Panzer III and IV.
        Despite of this, the Panzer II remained in service throughout the war, being the main light tank in German service and being used as a scout,
        although many wheeled vehicles preformed this specialized task far better. In this particular role, the Panzer II lacked both speed and range.
        It was gradually improved and produced until 1943, as no satisfactory replacement was ready in time.
        The origins of this model date back to 1934,
        when it became apparent to the Waffenamt (military ordnance bureau) that delays in the production of the Panzer III and IV led to the need of a new design to quickly replace the Panzer I.
        The specifications required a 10 ton tank with a 20 mm (0.79 in) autocannon. Krupp, AG, Daimler-Benz, MAN, Henschel, Sohn AG were contacted, and submitted their designs to the Waffenamt in 1935.
        The Krupp design was rejected, and a marriage of the Daimer-Benz hull and MAN chassis was chosen instead. This led to ten prototypes during late 1935, initially named LaS 100.
        Production was approved the same year.
