      <h2>Brief history</h2>
      <p>
        The Soviet Union began and ended the war with more tanks than the rest of the world combined (18,000–22,000).
        At the start of World War II the most common tank in Soviet service was the T-26 (derived from the Vickers 6-ton),
        lightly armoured and armed with a 45 mm gun capable of penetrating most German tanks at normal combat ranges.
        Few had radios. The design was mechanically sound although incapable of further development.
        The BT tank series, based on the Christie suspension system, were usually armed with the same 45 mm gun and were the most mobile tanks in the world.
        Close-support versions of both tanks existed, armed with 76.2 mm howitzers. However, the BT was at the end of its design life.
        The Red Army also fielded thousands of light reconnaissance tanks such as the amphibious T-37 and T-38 tanks. These had limited combat value; although highly mobile,
        they were armed only with 7.62 mm machine guns and had very thin armour. The Red Army also had about 400 T-28 medium,
        multi-turreted tanks, which were in most respects equal to the German Panzer IV. Again, though, this design dated from 1931 and was obsolete.
       </p>
       <p>
         The Soviet Union ended the 1930s with a huge fleet of tanks almost completely derived from foreign designs, but before 1941 developed some of the most important trend-setting tanks of the war.
         The problem the Soviet tank force faced in 1941 was not primarily the technical quality of its vehicles, but the very poor state of maintenance, the appalling lack of readiness,
         and the poor command situation brought on by the purges of the officer class. The Red Army had adopted in 1940 an advanced doctrine that it was simply incapable of executing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several excellent designs were just entering production in 1940–41. On the eve of war,
          the Red Army had embarked on two closely related projects to reorganize its mechanized forces and re-equip them with modern designs incorporating the lessons of the Spanish Civil War,
          the Battle of Khalkhin Gol and the Winter War. Some of these designs leapfrogged other countries' tank designs.
          The most significant was the T-34, originally designed as the successor to the BT series, but with its heavier armour and heavy dual-purpose gun,
          it became the best medium tank in the first half of World War II. The T-34 eventually replaced almost all other Soviet tanks.
          The basic design was good enough to keep it battle-worthy beyond 1945, having been upgraded with heavier guns, new turrets and other modifications.
          The second significant design was the KV-1 tank. These were armed with the same excellent 76.2 mm gun as the T-34, and had the same Kharkiv model V-2 diesel engine.
          However, the KV had a torsion bar suspension and much heavier armour than the T-34. The KV was slow, intended as a breakthrough tank.
          The KV-2 close-support version was armed with a 152 mm (6.0-inch) howitzer. The KV series was the main Soviet heavy tank until 1943, when production ended and most had been expended.
          Early in 1944 the KV's successor was the IS-2, armed with a 122 mm (4.8 in) gun, having thicker armour and better mobility.[12] The new infantry-support tank of 1941,
          intended to be the replacement for the T-26, was the T-50, armed with a 45 mm gun, with torsion-bar suspension and excellent armour for its class.
          Production problems with its new engine led to the tank being cancelled after less than 70 had been made. Finally, the light reconnaissance role was to be filled by the amphibious T-40 and the cheaper,
          non-amphibious T-60.

      <h3 class="h3-right">KV 1 heavy tank</h3>

      <p>
        The model 1939 was nearing 45 tons in weight, with a long hull (6.75 m/22.14 ft),
        relatively narrow if not for the very large tracks. The generous mudguards above gave exceptional room for storage. However,
        as no transmission was able to cope with such mass, the designers found an expedient, giving both prototypes and the SMK an old but sturdy Caterpillar system,
        which proved tricky, even unreliable in operations.
        The driver sat in the middle and the radio operator/machine gunner sat on the left, the three other crew members being located in and below the turret.
       </p>
       <p>
          They had poor visibility, with narrow vision slits.
          The driver had his frontal slit made of poor quality laminated glass, which proved blurred most of the time and his vision periscope had limited traverse.
          The commander (which also the loader) had two turret periscopes. The wheel train comprised front idler wheels and rear drive sprockets (like on the T-28) and a set of 6 twin roadwheel bogies,
          each sprung to an independent torsion-bar apparatus. There were also, due to the weight of the tracks,
          three large and thick return rollers. These large tracks had excellent traction on soft ground (snow and mud). The protection, reaching 90 mm (3.54 in) on the front (glacis and turret),
          was unrivaled for the time, if not for rare equivalents like the British Matilda II (80 mm/3.15 in) and the French B1 bis (70 mm/2.76 in), but way ahead of any German tank.

      <img class="img-float2" src="../Pictures/T34.png" alt="T34 tank" width="400" height="200">
      <p>
        The T-34 was and remains a legend. It is not only the most produced tank of the WWII-era,
        with 84,000 built (compared to the 48,966 Shermans of all versions) but also one of the longest-serving tanks ever built.
        Many are still stored in depots in Asia and Africa, and some served actively during the 90’s (such as during the 1991-99 Yugoslavian war).
        They formed the backbone of countless armored forces around the globe from the fifties to the eighties. The basic design was drawn for the first time in 1938 with the A-32,
        in turn partially derived from the BT-7M, a late evolution of the US-born Christie tank.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first version of the T-34/76 came as a nasty surprise for the overconfident German troops in the fall of 1941, when it was first committed en masse.
        Not only were they able to cope with the mud and snow with their large tracks, but they came with a perfect combination of thick and highly sloped armor,
        efficient gun, good speed, autonomy and, above all, extreme sturdiness, reliability, ease of manufacturing and maintenance.
        A perfect winner for an industrial war and a significant leap in tank design. While the T-34 did have a number of deficiencies,
        the T-34’s influence on the future designs and the concept of the main battle tank is unquestionable.

      <h3 class="h3-right">T50 light tank</h3>
      <img class="img-float2" src="../Pictures/T50.png" alt="T50 tank" width="400" height="200">
      <p>
      The T-50 was elaborated to replace older light reconnaissance models.
      Most of these had amphibious capabilities but lacked good protection and good armament required to deal with other armored vehicles.
      An RKKA specification from 1939 requested an infantry support light tank to replace the aging, mass-produced T-26, which was largely inspired by the British 1929 6-ton design,
      and the BT series, developed from the Christie prototype of 1930. The new T-50 design was to replace these older vehicles and operate alongside the BT-7Ms in service with the Red Army.
      It had many advanced features and, in many ways, looked like a “scaled-down T-34“. Would it have been indeed produced in numbers, it would had been a powerful addition to the Red Army arsenal.
      However, events decided otherwise
