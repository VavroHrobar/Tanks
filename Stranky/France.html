      <h2>Brief history</h2>
      <p>
        At the start of the war, France had one of the largest tank forces in the world along with the Soviet, British and German forces. Like the British and the Soviets,
        the French operated two classes of tank: cavalry tanks and infantry tanks.
        The French had planned for a defensive war and built tanks accordingly. Their infantry tanks were heavily armoured. But, also, generally, they were relatively sluggish,
        and operationally in terms of control of their forces, the French were at a disadvantage and were outmaneuvered by the German forces.
        When the French were able to mount an attack their tanks could be very effective. On 16 May, during the Battle of France a single Char B1 heavy tank, the Eure,
        attacked and destroyed thirteen German tanks lying in ambush in Stonne, all of them Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs, in the course of a few minutes.
        The tank safely returned despite being hit 140 times (this event is not verifiable in German documents and relies on the statements of the crew). In his book Panzer Leader,
        Heinz Guderian wrote of a tank battle south of Juniville:
        "While the tank battle was in progress, I attempted, in vain, to destroy a Char B with a captured 47 mm [1.9-inch] anti-tank gun;
        all the shells I fired at it simply bounced harmlessly off its thick armor. Our 37 mm and 20 mm guns were equally ineffective against this adversary.
        As a result, we inevitably suffered sadly heavy casualties".
        The total tank assets in France and its colonies were perhaps less than 5,800 during the time of the German offensive.
        After the armistice in the unoccupied Free Zone of France, a clandestine rebuild took place of 225 GMC Trucks into armoured cars.
        When all of France was occupied in 1942, the secret hiding places were betrayed to the Germans.

      <h3 class="h3-right">Renault D2 infantry tank</h3>
      <img class="img-float2" src="../Pictures/D2.png" alt="RenaultD2" width="400" height="200">
      <p>
        Even while the Renault D1 was still in development, a heavier version was requested by a directive of the direction de l’infanterie from 23 January 1930.
        This called for a medium tank (the D1 was a light model), with 40 mm (1.57 in) of armor, that was faster (13.67 mph/22 km/h) than the D1,
        which in turn required a far more powerful engine. Negotiations ended in April-May, Renault also agreeing to build an adapted version for the colonies,
        the D3.It was also hoped that it could replace the heavy B1 bis if the later would have been banned by an armament reduction treaty in negotiation at that time.
        However, this never happened, and the D2 soon became a low-priority project and the army greatly reduced the initial order of 750.
        Two batches of 50 would eventually be delivered by the company, the first in 1936-37 (called model 1935) and the second, much improved, in 1940 (model 1938).
       </p>
       <p>
      In most respects, the D2 was a slightly enlarged D1, retaining many features of the previous vehicle, like the vertical coil suspension design inherited from the Renault NC 27,
      and NC-1/NC-2 family. The D2 was still narrow, with the turret placed forward, immediately behind the driver’s compartment, and a long, sloped back engine hood.
      Massive side skirts with mud chutes, similar to the former vehicles,
      were also retained, composed of six panels. Previous experience dictated the return rollers to be placed higher to prevent track resonance.
      The tracks were 35 cm (13.78 in) wide. The suspension counted three bogies, each with four road wheels, one coil spring and two shock absorbers, per side.
      The crew was three, the radio operator being seated next to the driver, operating the hull Reibel machine-gun (low, right side). The commander was seated in the turret.
      As usual in this configuration, he had to operate the gun (loading, aiming and firing), serve the coaxial machine-gun and command the tank at the same time.
      There was a four-speed gearbox, and four fuel tanks, giving a 100 km (62 mi) range. The D2 could cross a 2.1 m (6.89 ft) wide trench, climb a 80 cm (2.62 ft) obstacle,
      climb slopes of 45° and ford 120 cm (3.94 ft) deep rivers.

      <h3 class="h3-right">Renault AMR 35 cavalery tank</h3>
      <img class="img-float2" src="../Pictures/AMC.png" alt="Renault AMR 35" width="400" height="200">
      <p>
        The AMR 35 (Auto Mitrailleuse de Reconnaissance) was not initially ordered by the army.
        Before the AMR 33 had even reached production stage, Louis Renault took two prototypes and completely overhauled them, starting in February 1934.
        Trials showed indeed the weight distribution -due to a forward-mounted engine- was a serious issue, and he addressed it first by placing a new, more powerful Nerva Stella 28 CV,
        Renault sport coupé regular engine.
        Changes were made accordingly to the transmission, because the drive sprockets were maintained at the front.
        This also considerably lowered the noise inside the fighting compartment. The ventilator and exhaust pipe were also shifted to the rear.
        The weak suspension of the AMR 33 was completely changed and tested on a third prototype made of bolted boiler plates in September 1934.

      <p>
        During the first trials at Vincennes, speeds up to 72 km/h (44 mph) were reached, an impressive feat for any tank of that time, especially with such a small engine.
        Louis Renault did not intend to support the cost of upgrading the production line, however the army was impressed, and General Flavigny insisted these changes had to be made.
        Cavalry officers noted that the engine was perhaps too delicate for military service and later asked for a sturdier one.
        Therefore, the second prototype was fitted with a 432 22 CV four-cylinder bus engine. Top speed was still 63 km/h (39 mph), with a weight of 5.03 tons.
        It was subsequently accepted into service as the AMR 35 and followed the AMR 33 on the factory line, sanctioned by an official order on July, 3, 1934.

      <h3 class="h3-right">Char B1/B1 bis heavy tank</h3>
      <img class="img-float2" src="../Pictures/Char.png" alt="Char B1/B1 bis" width="400" height="200">
      <p>
        The design process of this modified SRB led to the 1926 “tracteur 30”. The plans were made by Schneider’s chief engineer, revised by the STCC (Section Technique des Chars de Combat).
        A mockup was built by Renault and three prototypes were to be built by the companies involved, with some modifications by the new 1926 “direction de l’infanterie”,
        changing it to a primarily infantry support tank. Modifications of the design included no AT weapon, lower speed, 22 tons max and radio for coordination.
        The three prototypes of the “B” serie (n°101, 102 and 103) were ready by 1929-30. They differed by their engine,
        clutch, transmission and served both for technological and tactical experiments, at the champ de Châlons, forming the “Détachement d’Experimentation” unit in 1931.
        They were extensively used in maneuvers until 1934, each time with some modifications by the Atelier de Reuil near Paris, to meet new requirements and army specifications.
        In the end, the B1 received its final turret, with the low velocity 47 mm (1.85 in), and coaxial Reibel machine-gun.
        Like the 1924 prototypes, it had a very large track, inspired by earlier famous British models. Armor also protected the suspension and the hull was riveted.
        The Renault inline 6 cylinder 16.5 litre petrol engine was chosen, which provided 9.7 bhp/ton, the power was transmitted by a double differential steering system,
        5 forward, 1 reverse gear. Suspension was in the form of bogies with a mixture of vertical coil and leaf springs. Both early and final turret designs (APX1) were one-man only.
