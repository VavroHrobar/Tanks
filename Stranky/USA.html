      <h2>Brief history</h2>
      <p>Prior to the entry of the United States into the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941,
         the Army had only a few tanks. During the Louisiana Maneuvers in September 1941,
         it used trucks with the word "tank" painted on their side.
         Even after Pearl Harbor the 10th Armored Division did not have any tanks,
         so crews trained by marching down roads in groups and executing orders as if they were in tanks.
       </p>
       <p>The Light Tank M2 series was the most important pre-war US tank.
          These light tanks were mechanically very reliable,
          with good mobility. However, they had a high silhouette — from the use of an air-cooled radial engine for power — and poor armor.
          Only a few saw combat, on Guadalcanal.
          Their importance lies in the fact that they formed the basis for the much more successful Light Tank M3 (a.k.a. Stuart) series beginning in 1941.
          The Stuart was an improvement of the M2, with heavier armor and a 37 mm gun. From the M3A1 version, this gun was gyrostabilized.
          The new medium tank just entering production in 1940 was the M2 series. This was a poor design with thin armor, a high silhouette, a 37 mm main gun and seven machine guns.
        </p>
        <p>
          From 1940, new tank designs were prepared.
          The Battle of France had shown the importance of medium tanks.
          The British Army sought to have the US manufacture British designs, but the US refused,
          offering instead to share the output of US factories building US designs.
          The United States Army had a requirement for a medium tank with a 75 mm gun, and developed the M3 Medium Tank as an interim design.
          The medium M3 tank was intended to quickly get a 75 mm gun into the field,
          pending the design of a tank with a 75 mm gun in a fully rotating turret.
          The British immediately ordered the M3 for their own use with modifications to their requirements.
          By February 1942, American civilian automobile factories only made weapons and military vehicles.
          Automobile manufacturers such as General Motors and Chrysler used their experience with mass production to quickly build tanks.
          The country manufactured as many tanks in the first half of 1942 as in all of 1941, with 1,500 in May 1942 alone.
          American production not only equipped its forces,
          but through Lend Lease also supplied all the tank needs of the free French (after 1942) and Chinese.
          By 1944 most British units were also equipped with US-built tanks. Finally, the US supplied over 8,000 tanks to the USSR,
          half of them the M4 Sherman. Similarly to the Soviet Union,
          the United States selected a few good basic designs and standardized on those models.
          Given the lack of tank design and production experience, it is remarkable that the United States designs were as good as they were.
          The first tanks of the United States to see combat were the Light Tank M3.
          They were deeply flawed in many ways,
          yet the M3 light ("Stuart") and M3 medium ("Lee" or "Grant") were the best tanks available
          to the Western Allies and were superior to many of their German counterparts in armor protection and firepower.
          The Light Tank M3 was about as well-armed as the British cruiser tanks with 2-pounder guns in the desert,
          yet was much more reliable mechanically. Its 37 mm main gun was more powerful than the main guns carried by German reconnaissance tanks.
          The name given by the British to the Light Tank M3 was 'Stuart'; a nickname used was 'Honey'.
          The M3 and its improved derivative, the Light Tank M5 series, remained in service throughout the war.
          By 1943, its 37 mm gun was obsolete, but no better replacement was available.
          The Light Tank T7 design was proposed as a successor in 1943, armed with a 57 mm gun and with better armor;
          however, the design was never standardized for production.

      <h3 class="h3-right">Sherman medium tank</h3>
      <img class="img-float2" src="../Pictures/Sherman.png" alt="Tank Sherman" width="400" height="200">
      <p>The M4 Sherman (named after the famous American Civil War general William T. Sherman)
         is one of the few really iconic fighting vehicles of the Allies during World War Two,
         and one of the most famous tanks in history. But while this historic status was gained partly thanks to its intrinsic qualities,
         but also due to the sheer numbers in which they were provided, only surpassed by the Soviet Union’s T-34, with a staggering 50,000 total delivered.
         It remains by far the most widely used tank on the Allied side during the war.
         It was derived into countless derivatives and had a very long postwar career which lasted well into the Cold War.
         It has been largely compared to the T-34, and had the occasion to confront some during the Korean War.
       </p>
       <p>
          However, the Sherman was not as successful as it seemed.
          Derived in a haste from the previous and controversial M3 Lee/Grant,
          it was the first to bear a fully-traversing turret with a 75 mm (2.95 in) gun.
          It was designed from the very beginning for mass-production.
          Cheap and relatively simple to build, easy to maintain, reliable, roomy, sturdy, fast, well-armored and well-armed,
          it was the good-all-around armored vehicle the Allies had sought for until 1942, when it first arrived on the North African front.
          It literally soldiered in every corner of the globe, under many colors, from 1942 to the end of the war.
          These theaters included (in WWII alone) most of North Africa, Russia, most of Europe, the Eastern Indies, the Philippines, many Pacific islands and China.

      <h3 class="h3-right">Stuart light tank</h3>

      <p>
        The core reason behind the development of the M5 was probably the rapidly growing demand for radial engines,
        which were in short supply. Therefore, other sources were approached in order to have the tank production still running in early 1941.
        In June, OCM 16837 authorized the installation of two Cadillac engines mated on a single crankshaft and hydramatic transmission and auxiliary transmission M3 (transfer case).
        Cadillac had been, indeed, rarely involved with wartime production until then. The combination of systems gave 6 speeds forward and one reverse, and a very smooth steering.
        The M3E2 prototype was therefore tested with this arrangement on a 2000 miles (3200 km) crash course at the GM proving grounds. The results being excellent,
        testing resumed at Aberdeen, aiming to gain the General Staff’s approval. Although this modification made the M3 2,500 lbs heavier (1133 kg), performance was overall preserved.
        The vehicle required a lower temperature starter, was quieter and more compact, freeing space inside because of the lower drive shaft.
        It also benefited from both simplified maintenance and training.

      <h3 class="h3-right">Hellcat tank destroyer</h3>
      <img class="img-float2" src="../Pictures/Hellcat.png" alt="Hellcat tank destroyer" width="400" height="200">
      <p>
        In December 1941, the Ordnance Corps issued a requirement for a fast tank destroyer using torsion bar suspension, a Wright/Continental R-975 engine, and a 37 mm (1.46 in) gun.
        This became the T42 37 mm (1.46 in) Gun Motor Carriage.
        The army then changed their request to a vehicle mounting a 57 mm (2.24 in) gun, thus the designation changed to the T49 57 mm Gun Motor Carriage.
        Yet another change, requesting a 75 mm (2.95 in) gun, led to the T67 Gun Motor Carriage, of which one was built from a T49 chassis.
        Finally, the T70 76 mm Gun Motor Carriage emerged and would become the M18 Hellcat. It was designed by Harley Earl at Buick.
        Tests on an oval track, as well as a specially designed bumpy track, demonstrated that the lightly armored vehicle could achieve high speeds.
        Production of the M18 started on January 7th, 1943, when 1,000 units were ordered.
